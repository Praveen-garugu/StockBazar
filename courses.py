Companies go public through Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), allowing their shares to be traded.
    Stock prices are influenced by supply and demand dynamics. When more people want to buy, prices rise; when more people want to sell, prices fall. Market indices like the S&P 500 offer insights into market performance.
    Investors range from individuals to institutions with diverse objectives. Stocks offer opportunities for capital growth and dividends but come with market risks.

This market operates through stock exchanges like the NYSE and NASDAQ, where supply and demand dynamics determine security prices, offering opportunities for various market participants, including individual investors, institutions, and traders. While the secondary market doesn't directly raise capital for issuing entities, it plays a critical role in providing an exit strategy for investors and contributes to price discovery, making it an essential element of the financial ecosystem.
