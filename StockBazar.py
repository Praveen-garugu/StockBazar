As unlisted stocks are not with the market regulating authority – the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), it is not safe to invest in them</p>

By using stock screeners, you can apply a few filters (like PE ratio, debt to equity ratio, market cap, etc) specific to the industry which you are investigating and get a list of limited stocks based on the criteria applied.</p>

                                <p style="color:cyan;font-size:19px;margin-left:30px;margin-top:14px;">Small caps companies have the caliber to grow faster compared to large caps. There can be a number of hidden gems in the small-cap industry which might not have been discovered by the market yet. However, their true potential is still untested. On the other hand, large-cap companies have already proved their worth to the market.
                    Anyways, the quality of stock is more important than the size of the company. There are a number of large-cap companies which has consistently given good returns to their shareholders. Overall, investing in small caps can be more profitable than large caps if you are investing in the right stocks</p>

                                <p style="color:cyan;font-size:19px;margin-left:30px;margin-top:14px;">During a good market, your portfolio can give you a return as high as 30-35% (the benchmark index Nifty alone gave a return of over 50.20% in the last year till Sept 2021). However, during a bad market- the returns can be as low as 2-5% or maybe even negative.

                    If you sum up everything, you can expect an annual return of 15-18%, depending on how good you were at picking stocks. Nevertheless, you can generate an even better return if you are ready to put in some hard work.</p>

                                <p style="color:cyan;font-size:19px;margin-left:30px;margin-top:14px;">The individual should avoid investing in stocks having low liquidity. The low liquidity makes it hard to trade in these stocks. Additionally, finding the data for analysing these companies might be hard as information on public platforms is generally not easily available. Thus, lack of research may result in loss-making investments. Additionally, one should also avoid investing in penny stocks.</p>

It's the price at which the stock starts trading after the market's opening bell. The opening price is an important reference point for traders and investors as it provides an initial indication of market sentiment for the day.
